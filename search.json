Moreover, the abundance of different pollinators vary greatly between years due to rapid changes in insect population sizes. Understanding the variations in the contributions of pollinator taxa to pollen transfer over time is crucial to understanding the long-term community dynamics and could help in conserving pollination services amid pollinator decline.\n\n\n\nResearch Questions\nHow much pollinator contributions to pollen transfer depend on their ability to carry pollen and their abundance? How the pollen load vary among and within pollinator taxa? How the flower-visitation density vary year-to-year?\n\n\nMethods\n\nPollen load on pollinator body\nWe collected pollen from a half of pollinator´s body with a small block of fuchsine jelly following Beatie (1972). Pollen grains were counted on microscope slides. Pollen in pollen baskets was not sampled as it does not reach plant stigmas.\n\n\n\nPollinator abundance:\n93 permanent plots (4×4 m) evenly distributed over the meadow are censused for plant and pollinator densities following the same protocol every season since 2011. Only insects touching plant´s reproductive organs for at least 2 seconds are recorded as pollinators.\n\n\n\nResults\nPollen load: The pollen amount carried on pollinator body varied among pollinator taxa, but the differences were small, and that such variability was mainly driven by intraspecific differences among individual pollinators\nAbundance: The interaction density significantly differed among taxa and changed over the years. The abundance of pollinators fluctuated highly from year to year, being presumably responsible for the majority of the variation in the species-species importance of pollinators for a given plant species, and may lead to a high turnover in plant-pollinator interactions and pollen transfer.\nPollinator contributions to pollen transfer in our system depended on the amounts of pollen carried and the number of plant-pollinator interactions, which varied over time and over the years. Pollinator species diversity may be crucial in compensating for the variation in pollinator abundances at the community level\n\nbb\n\n\n\nConclusions\n→ No big variation in pollen load among pollinator\n→ Huge differences in pollinator densities over the years\n→ Each pollinator taxa is important and necessary for plant polination even in highly generalised meadow ecosystems!\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n     Download poster"
